```
`#1` Cntrl + c  - Copy
```
```diff
        ! This ke short cut is to copy 
```
```diff
        - Advanced thing is, if you don't select a word or char, then it simply `COPY` whole `LINE`
```
***
```
`#2` `Cntrl + v` || `Cmd + v` & `Cntrl + shift + v` || `Cmd + shift + v` - Paste
```
```diff
        ! This ke short cut is to Paste content 
```
```diff
        - Advanced thing is, if you copied a specia text and you want paste in same format of current doc then you need to use `Cntrl+shift+v`
